# Backe Construction AS Website

## Introduction
This is milestone project 1: User centric front-end development, for Code Institute’s Full-stack development program.

The idea of the project is to build a static front-end site for Backe Construction AS, a small Norwegian company offering construction services in Oslo and Viken regions. The company doesn't have any online presence for now except for a pin on Google Maps. They want to create a better credibility for the company and more online presence in order to attract new customers.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories
1. As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate through the website to find out the information I need.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to learn more about what kind of services the company offers.
3. As a first time visitor, I want to see previous work they have done, so that I can estimate their competencies.
4. As a first time visitor, I want to quickly send a message, so that I can ask further questions or to get a quote from the company.
5. As a returning visitor, I want to quickly find contact information of the company.

### Strategy
The company's goal of the website is to present the company and attract customers.
The external user’s goal is to know more about what kind of services the company offers and the work they have done as well as how to contact them.

### Scope
In order to narrow down what the website should be included, a list of requirements for both content and functionality was identified.

1. Content requirements:
* Company's motto
* Who they are and the area they primarily serve
* The services the company offers
* Previous work
* Contact information
2. Functionality requirements:
* Easy navigation to find the information that the user needs
* Image gallery to showcase previous work and improve company's credibility
* Contact form which allows users to quickly send inquiries or ask for quotes

### Structure
1. Design
* Color scheme:
  * The website’s color scheme is based on the company’s current business card with primary color is blue (hex #0089D0) same as the logo and secondary color is yellow (hex #FFE161).
* Typography:
  * The main font being used throughout the website is Montserrat and the fallback font is Sans Serif in case of failure loading the main font.
* Imagery:
  * The company provides a folder of all images they have. Due to low quality and resolution, those images can only be used for showcasing their work. For other visual elements, stock images are chosen.

2. Wireframes
